# refonte_sony_MD

This is my first project to learn HTML and CSS. 
I did some tests and tried to understand how I could better code. 
There is a file ".odt" understand that contains my self-criticism regarding this project.
I probably couldn't finish this project but I can redo it when I will learn new languages and frameworks (JS, Bootstrap, material design etc..)

I wanted to make a graphic redesign of the Sony site using only HTML and CSS
